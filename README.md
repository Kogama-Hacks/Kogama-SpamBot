## What's new in v1.1?
- Added ability to spam-comment on profile posts (see [#How to use](./README.md#user-content-new1))
- Added a question to decide whether it should log out if CTRL+C is pressed or not (see [#How to use](./README.md#user-content-new2))

<a href="javascript:void(x=document.getElementById('user-content-new1');x.innerHTML='<u>'+x.innerHTML+'</u>')">test</a>
## Download
To download, click "releases" on the right side of your screen, then scroll to the version you want to download.
On the versions, you will see 5 files:
 - spambot.onedir.zip - everything (Python, modules, etc.) is bundled in the single directory.
 - spambot.onefile.exe - everything (Python, modules, etc.) is bundled in the single exe.
 - spambot.src.py - source Python script.
 - sourcecode.zip and .tar.gz - contain everything in this repo (the readme file).

## How to use

Launch the variant you prefer (source .py, single exe or directory). All of them work basically the same.

Then, it will prompt you to enter the Kogama server. Enter either 'www', 'friends' or 'br'.
www: https://www.kogama.com
friends: https://friends.kogama.com
br: https://kogama.com.br

Now, it will ask you which object it should spam on.
Enter the ID of the object. Add prefix 'a-' if you mean an avatar, add prefix 'i-' if you mean a model or add prefix 'p-' if you mean a profile post. Adding no prefix treats the ID as game ID.
Examples:
136436 - game ID
a-453235 - avatar ID
i-557743 - model ID
*New:* <span id="new1"></span>
p-355433 - profile post ID

*Note: commenting on avatars and models works only if that avatar/model is sold.*

After that, it will ask you which text it should write in the comments. Type in the text you want to spam in the comments.

Then, enter your kogama username and password (they are required because the script will login with that account data to be able to write comments).

*New:* <span id="new2"></span>
It will then ask you if it should log out the account when it gets crashed by pressing CTRL+C in the program window. If you write `1` it will do so, if you write anything else (e.g. `4ettrd` or `â€‹`), it will not.

Now it will spam comments.

To exit, press CTRL+C in the program window or just close the program.
